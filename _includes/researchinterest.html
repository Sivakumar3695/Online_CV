			I am interested in studying Machine Learning (ML) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and algorithms for graphs. As far as ML algorithms are concerned, my current research interest involves graph classification problems where I am working on improving graph filtration curves for efficient graph classification. My favourite RL area is to focus on creating and analysing algorithms to make an agent curious to explore and learn in as few episodes as possible in the Markov Decision Process (MDP) settings. <br><br>

In the theory of computing, I am currently researching online bipartite matching graph algorithms to improve the approximation ratio. My literature study in this area extensively involves analysing and designing conceptually simple algorithms.
