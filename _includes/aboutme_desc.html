	I am a software engineer. With five years of experience in the industry, I can write computer programs that will run optimally while it also can be maintained easily. I can build complete web applications, and my hobby is to develop small apps that help my daily activities. I always encourage new programmers to apply Object-Oriented programming to write good code and maintain consistency in learning to stay up-to-date with the ever-changing world of technology. I completed my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.cit.edu.in/" target="_blank"><b>Coimbatore Institute of Technology</b></a>, affiliated with Anna University, India. I closely worked with my professor Ramraj Thirupathyraj. Working together, we completed a research paper on a graph problem in the Argumentation Framework and more recently, he took me as a Research Assistant on his current study on graph isomorphism. 
	<br><br>I am a Machine Learning (ML) enthusiast who enjoys reading research articles on ML theory. I like working on the math behind every fascinating algorithm since it is satisfying to understand and solve <b>theory</b> works, and I look to explore more such studies in the future. Currently, I focus on doing my graduate degree, where I mainly like to focus on the theoretical works and algorithms in the primary areas of my research interest. 
	<br><br>I always believe that <b>perseverance</b> is the key to success when things get tough. So, it would be good to "STAY humble and STAY focused" during ups and downs.
