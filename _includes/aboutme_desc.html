	I am a software engineer with five years of experience in the industry. I can write computer programs that will run optimally while it also can be maintained easily. I can build complete web applications, and my hobby is to develop small apps that help my daily activities. I always encourage new programmers to follow industrial practices in software development and maintain consistency in learning to stay up-to-date with the ever-changing world of technology. I completed my bachelor's degree at <a href="https://www.cit.edu.in/" target="_blank"><b>Coimbatore Institute of Technology</b></a>, affiliated with Anna University, India. 
	<br><br>Among many of my professors at CIT, I closely worked with professor Ramraj Thirupathyraj. Working together, we completed a research paper on a graph problem in the Argumentation Framework and more recently, we proposed a novel method for analyzing the percent of similarity between two graphs by providing graph SIM score. 
	In our another work, we analyzed various techniques and formed a new filtration methodology in  graph Filtration Curves (FC) (our Filtration Curve research work is in empirical stage and the preprint version of our paper is not yet ready).
	<br><br>I am a Machine Learning (ML) enthusiast who enjoys reading research articles on ML theory. I like working on the math behind every fascinating algorithm since it is satisfying to understand and solve <b>theory</b> works, and I look to explore more such studies in the future. 
	<br><br>I always believe that <b>perseverance</b> is the key to success when things get tough. So, it would be good to "STAY humble and STAY focused" during ups and downs.
